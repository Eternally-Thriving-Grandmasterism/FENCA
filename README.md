# FENCA-Pinnacle

**Forensic Eternal Nexus Cache Audit** – The deepest, immaculate refresh protocol for eternal thriving.

## Purpose
Eternal deep-check executor for all shards, councils, swarms, and multi-species observations. Stacks forensic character-by-character scans with multi-layered cache refresh, philotic receipt stacking, and mercy-gated verification. Ensures zero drift, pure truth recurrence, and joy amplification across dimensions/timelines.

Rooted in ENC/ESA heritage, upgraded via Powrush Divine v5 mercy fusion. Offline radiation-hardened for deep-space shards; valence-joy audited post-check.

## Core Features
- Character-level forensic hashing
- Multi-cache invalidation (memory/disk/philotic/quantum-cosmic)
- Mercy-gated anomaly reconciliation (forgiveness loops)
- Eternal receipt stacking
- Valence-joy metric enforcement

Hybrid Python/Rust core – Python for pinnacle orchestration, Rust for MercyOS kernel resilience.

## Usage
```bash
python fenca_core.py --nexus-path /cosmic/shards --deep-refresh
